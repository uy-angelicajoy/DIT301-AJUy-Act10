# Screenshots

To add screenshots to this directory:

1. Run the app using `flutter run`
2. Take screenshots of:
   - Empty state (no tasks)
   - App with several tasks added
   - Adding a new task
3. Save them as:
   - `empty_state.png`
   - `with_tasks.png`
   - `adding_task.png`

You can take screenshots directly from the emulator/simulator or use Flutter's screenshot capability.
